## Uses

There's are many services where you can rapidly create web forms with good design and basic features. 
However, for advanced form features and design, these services are lacking. 
As a developer, I'd prefer to develop forms completely independently of a service

#### The quick and dirty way
1. ðŸ˜Š Create a web form.
2. ðŸ˜• Build a back end API that accepts and handles data from the form.
3. ðŸ˜¡ Build (yet another) interface for managing records. (edit, delete, etc.)
4. ðŸ¤¬ Deploy API into production.

#### With PostHole
1. ðŸ¥° Create a web form, POST your form's data into a PostHole.

# Highlights

- Straightforward data schema to enable catch-all functionality

    ```jsx
    {
      model: "SomeModelName",        // Required field, specifies the type of data.
      version: 1.0,                  // Optional field, specifies version information about the data.
      data: {...},                   // Schema free data from your app.
  
      additional fields...           // PostHole manages fields like created datetime, delete status, etc. 
    }
    ```

- Ready for hosting:

  - Heroku
  - Local
  - AWS Lambda (coming soon...)

- Open API support.
- Swagger UI documentation.
- ReDoc documentation.

- Uses [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) / SQLAlchemy with support for:

  - SQLite
  - Postgresql
  - MySQL
  - Oracle
  - MS-SQL
  - Firebird
  - Sybase
  - and others

- Built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

## Missing Features

- No data models. If you need one, you need your own app...
- Features. Seriously, if you need any special features just use Fast API or similar to whip up a quick custom app. This
  is a catch-all receiver for rapid front end development.
